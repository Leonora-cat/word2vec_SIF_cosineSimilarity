# word2vec_SIF_cosineSimilarity

This project simulates a intelligent question and answer system. In a web demo, users can input a question and the system will return similar questions together with their similarities and their questions.

## Input Files

1 file containing question ID, question content, answer keyword and answer content

## Method

uses word2vec and SIF algorithm to generate word vectors and then sentence vectors, and uses cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between 2 sentences, the most similar questions will be returned.

#### Front-end, Back-end and Their Interaction

This project uses flask module and jQuery for interactions between front-end and back-end
