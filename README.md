# Word2vec_SIF_cosineSimilarity

This project simulates an intelligent question and answer system. In a web demo, users can input a question and the system will return similar questions together with their similarities and their questions.

## Input Files

1 file containing question ID, question content, answer keyword and answer content

## Method

uses word2vec and SIF algorithm to generate word vectors and then sentence vectors, and uses cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between 2 sentences, the most similar questions will be returned.
